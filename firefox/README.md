# Trunic-Translator
A browser extension that allows users to translate pages into Trunic, the fictional language from the game Tunic.

To install, clone the repository and add the directory to Chrome as an unpacked extension.

To use:
- Go to your extensions list (the jigsaw peice to the right of the search bar)
- Pin the extension to your search bar
- Click the extension button and click the "translate" button in the pop-up.
Translating is currently very slow, and it can take upwards of a minute or two depending on how many words are on a page.
